WHAT IS THIS?

This is CGI.pm, an easy-to-use Perl5 library for writing World
Wide Web CGI scripts.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README
file and type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If this doesn't work for you, try:

   cp CGI.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5

If you have trouble installing CGI.pm because you have insufficient
access privileges to add to the perl library directory, you can still
use CGI.pm.  See the docs for details.

WHAT SYSTEMS DOES IT WORK WITH?

This module works with NT, Windows, Macintosh, OS/2 and VMS servers,
although it hasn't been tested as extensively as it should be.  See
the docs for notes on your particular platform.

WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?

You'll find very verbose documentation in the file cgi_docs.html,
located in the top level directory.  

Terser documentation is found in POD (plain old documentation) form in
CGI.pm itself.  When you install CGI, the MakeMaker program will
automatically install the manual pages for you (on Unix systems, type
"man CGI").

WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES?

A collection of examples demonstrating various CGI features and
techniques are in the directory "examples".  Many more examples of CGI
scripts of various degrees of complexity can be found at:

   http://www.genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/examples/Ch9/

WHERE IS THE ONLINE DOCUMENTATION?

Online documentation of for CGI.pm, and notifications of new versions
can be found at:

   http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/

A copy of the HTML documentation can be found in the package in the
file cgi_docs.html or in the standard POD pages.

WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?

I have written a book about CGI.pm called "The Official Guide to
Programming with CGI.pm" which was published by John Wiley & Sons in
May 1998.  If you like CGI.pm, you'll love this book.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

Version 2.69 emits XHTML by default.  To get the old behavior, use the
-no_xhtml pragma.

Versions 2.44-2.46 introduce two API changes that will affect
users of previous versions:

1) The accept() function has been renamed Accept() to avoid conflicting with
Perl's built-in function of the same name.

2) The sub() function has been renamed Sub() for similar reasons.

My apologies for these changes, but they were necessary in order for
CGI to pass the perl5.005 regression tests!

Have fun, and let me know how it turns out!
