%description
Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without references. Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintainance for package developers. For example, generic functions are created automatically, if missing, and name conflict are automatically solved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future want to migrate to S4. The package has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable.

brining forward

Revision 1.3  2006/08/31 18:52:44  allenday
factoring out package name to reduce editing cost

Revision 1.2  2006/07/15 01:55:20  boconnor
I updated the hardcoded /usr directory in all the spec files.  This was to support MacOS which installs all RPMs into /usr/local.  It uses a RPM macro now to make it platform neutral.  I've also updated some other SPEC files to support MacOS, I've done my best to ensure any changes don't affect other platforms negatively

Revision 1.1  2006/05/23 19:04:02  allenday
imports for afy fusion skd
