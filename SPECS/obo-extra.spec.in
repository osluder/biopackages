%description
Open Biomedical Ontologies is an umbrella web address for well-structured controlled vocabularies for shared use across different
biological and medical domains. 

1. The ontologies must be open and can be used by all without any constraint other than that their origin must be acknowledged and
they cannot be altered and redistributed under the same name. 

The OBO ontologies are for sharing and are resources for the entire community. For this reason, they must be available to all without
any constraint or license on their use or redistribution. However, it is proper that their original source is always credited and that
after any external alterations, they must never be redistributed under the same name or with the same identifiers. 

2. The ontologies are in, or can be instantiated in, a common shared syntax. This may be either the GO syntax, extensions of this
syntax, or OWL. 

The reason for this is that the same tools can then be usefully applied. This facilitates shared software implementations. This
criterion is not met in all of the ontologies currently listed, but we are working with the ontology developers to have them available
in a common OBO syntax. 

3. The ontologies are orthogonal to other ontologies already lodged within OBO. 

The major reason for this principle is to allow two different ontologies, for example anatomy and process, to be combined through
additional relationships. These relationships could then be used to constrain when terms could be jointly applied to describe
complementary (but distinguishable) perspectives on the same biological or medical entity.  As a corollary to this, we would strive
for community acceptance of a single ontology for one domain, rather than encouraging rivalry between ontologies. 

4. The ontologies share a unique identifier space. 

The source of concepts from any ontology can be immediately identified by the prefix of the identifier of each concept. It is,
therefore, important that this prefix be unique. 

5. The ontologies include textual definitions of their terms. 

Many biological and medical terms may be ambiguous, so concepts should be defined so that their precise meaning within the context of
a particular ontology is clear to a human reader.
