%description
File::Slurp.pm version 0.04
===========================

This module provides subroutines to read or write entire files with a
simple call.  It also has a subroutine for reading the list of filenames
in a directory.

In the extras/ directory you can read an article (slurp_article.pod)
about file slurping and also run a benchmark (slurp_bench.pl) that
compares many ways of slurping/spewing files.

This module was first written and owned by David Muir Sharnoff (MUIR on
CPAN).  I checked out his module and decided to write a new version
which would be faster, and with many more features.  To that end, David
graciously transfered the namespace to me.

Since then, I discovered and fixed a bug in the original module's test
script (which had only 7 tests), which is included now as t/original.t.
This module now has 164 tests in 7 test scripts, and passes on Windows,
Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.

There have been some comments about the somewhat unusual version number.
The problem was that David used a future date (2004.0904) in his version
number, and the only way I could get CPAN to index my new module was to
make it have a version number higher than the old one, so I chose the
9999 prefix and appended the real revision number to it.

Revision 1.2  2006/07/15 01:55:21  boconnor
I updated the hardcoded /usr directory in all the spec files.  This was to support MacOS which installs all RPMs into /usr/local.  It uses a RPM macro now to make it platform neutral.  I've also updated some other SPEC files to support MacOS, I've done my best to ensure any changes don't affect other platforms negatively
