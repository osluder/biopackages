%description
GDD is a graphics device for R which uses libgd for creating bitmap output. Supported output formats are png8, png24, gif and jpeg.

See RoSuDa package repository for the latest release.

The main purpose of this package is to replace png/jpeg and similar native devices in R which either rely on X11 or use GhostScript are thus are very slow and not suitable in server applications. GDD also supports advanced features such as anti-aliasing of both lines and text.

The GDD package is very fresh so there is not much documentation available at the moment. For full-featured operation it requires gd-2.0.28 or higher with freetype support. Since GDD 0.1-4 gdlib-conf is used to detect GD for more reliable flag detection. See the README file inside the package for details on requirements and font handling.

As an alternative, if you want a stand-alone GDD with statically linked png/jpeg/freetype and gd libraries, consider unpacking the GDD package to /tmp and specify /tmp/GDD/ext as the prefix for all the above libraries and using --disable-shared. After compiling and installing all the libraries, use R CMD INSTALL /tmp/GDD to compile and install the GDD package. Again, this is only necessary if there is no shared version of libgd on your system and you can't easily get one.

This package is released unter GPL (see DESCRIPTION file inside the package for details).

fixed mkdir/rm -rf issue

Revision 1.4  2006/07/15 01:55:20  boconnor
I updated the hardcoded /usr directory in all the spec files.  This was to support MacOS which installs all RPMs into /usr/local.  It uses a RPM macro now to make it platform neutral.  I've also updated some other SPEC files to support MacOS, I've done my best to ensure any changes don't affect other platforms negatively
